# Breaking Bad Characters

Esta aplicação busca os personagens e episódios da série Breaking Bad da Breaking Bad API (https://www.breakingbadapi.com/ ).\
Ela mostra uma lista de personagens com suas informações básicas. Quando um personagem é clicado, são mostradas todas as suas informações e uma lista de aparições.\
A lista de aparições é criada baseada nas informações dos episódios buscada na API e nem todos os personagens que aparecem nos episódios são listados.\
Por essa razão, alguns personagens não possuem uma lista de aparições.\
\
This application fetches the Breaking Bad's characters and episodes from The Breaking Bad API (https://www.breakingbadapi.com/ ).\
It shows a characters list with their basic information. When a character is clicked, it is shown all the information and a list of appearances.\
The list of appearances is created based on the fetched episodes information and not every character that appears in the episodes is listed.\
Because of that, some characters has no appearances list on their details page.

## Personal Notes

Os dados buscados na API não são volumosos e não aumentarão, então não foi necessária uma paginação durante a busca.\
Com isso em mente, as tarefas de busca e criação do Array de aparições foram facilitadas.\
\
The fetched data is not bulky and it will not scale, so it was not necessary a pagination when fetching.\
With that in mind, the data fetching and the appearances array's creation was simpler.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
